### Hi, I'm Mithun! 👋

I lead engineering at **Sky**, building backend systems powering **Sports, Entertainment, and News** across Europe.  

Core focus: **Distributed systems**, **Machine Learning**, and partnership integrations with:

After hours, I'm working on a new project: **[ants at salt](https://usesalt.co)** — an **AI-powered coordination & orchestration system** designed for enterprises to optimize AIOps flows.

I just love building stuff — sometimes cool things, but most times horrible ones
