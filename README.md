### Hi, I'm Mithun 👋

Engineering lead at [Sky](https://www.sky.de/). I build things that (usually) don't crash —
distributed systems, ML pipelines, agentic architectures, and the plumbing that keeps
Sports, Entertainment & News running across Europe.

Currently herding very smart, slightly sarcastic ants at [SALT](https://usesalt.co).

I work with teams at [![Netflix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netflix-E50914?style=flat&logo=netflix&logoColor=white)](https://www.netflix.com/) [![DAZN](https://img.shields.io/badge/DAZN-EE291F?style=flat&logo=dazn&logoColor=white)](https://www.sky.de/pakete-produkte/sky-dazn) [![Disney+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Disney+-113CCF?style=flat&logo=disney&logoColor=white)](https://www.disneyplus.com/) [![DHL](https://img.shields.io/badge/DHL-FFCC00?style=flat&logo=dhl&logoColor=D40511)](https://www.dhl.com/) and others.

Curious about human simulation and AR — the blurry bit where digital stops feeling fake.
*(Your coffee is still real. Probably.)*
