### Hi, I'm Mithun!

I lead engineering at Sky, building backend powering Sports, Entertainment and News across Europe. Corely working on distributed systems, Machine Learning and Partnership integrations with Netflix, DAZN, Disney+, DHL and more.

Post work working on a new project, building ants on SALT (usesalt.co), AI powered cordination & orchestration system designed for enterprises to optimize AIOps flow.

I just love building stuff - sometimes cool things but most times horrible ones.

If you wanna build something or just wanna chat, reach me on x.com (itsjustmithun)
