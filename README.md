Hi, I'm Mithun! 👋

I lead engineering at [Sky](https://www.sky.de/), building the backend that powers Sports, Entertainment & News across Europe.

I specialize in distributed systems, ML models, and agentic architectures with a focus on operational efficiency.

I build orchestration engines, content delivery systems, payment systems and partnership integrations, working closely with engineering teams at [![Netflix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netflix-E50914?style=flat&logo=netflix&logoColor=white)](https://www.netflix.com/) [![DAZN](https://img.shields.io/badge/DAZN-EE291F?style=flat&logo=dazn&logoColor=white)](https://www.sky.de/pakete-produkte/sky-dazn) [![Disney+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Disney+-113CCF?style=flat&logo=disney&logoColor=white)](https://www.disneyplus.com/) [![DHL](https://img.shields.io/badge/DHL-FFCC00?style=flat&logo=dhl&logoColor=D40511)](https://www.dhl.com/) and many more.

Lately I've been obsessed with [SALT](https://usesalt.co), a coordination & orchestration layer for AI agents. Think herding very smart, slightly sarcastic ants.

**I love building stuff**. Some things turn out great. Some are gloriously broken, but honestly those teach me more than the successes ever do.

Deeply into human simulation, augmented reality, and that blurry line where digital stops feeling fake. *(Your coffee is still real. Probably.)*

Wanna build something cool? Find me on [X](https://x.com/itsjustmithun) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsjustmithun/) or just poke around here.

*Let's make something great. Or at least make sure it doesn't explode.*
